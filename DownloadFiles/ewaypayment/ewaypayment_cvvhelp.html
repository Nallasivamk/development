	<p><b>What is a Credit Card Verification Number and why does KinCare want it ? </b></p>	
	<P>We collect your credit card verification number (CVN) to protect you and us against fradulent charges on your credit card. If your card number were to be stolen (say from that old statement that you threw into the trash) the person who stole the number would not be able to complete the transaction because they would not have the verification number. </P>
	<P>According to all of the major credit card companies, these verification numbers are the wave of the future. The CVN doesn't tell us anything about you, it's only purpose is an additional level of security, in the event of a fraudulent charge, to protect you. </P>
	<p><b>Where do I find my CVN ?</b></p>
	<p>On the reverse side of Mastercard, Visa, and Discover/Novus credit cards, there is a number printed on the signature strip. The CVN is the last three digits (shown below).</p>

	<p>For American Express cards, the CVN is printed just above the embossed number on the front of the card (shown below).</p>
